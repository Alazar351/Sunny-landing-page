## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Layouts built with grid can be rearranged and/or stretched. There is also a way to view every grid and flex elements in the inspector. Clamp is useful to get a range of values.

### Continued development

I want to dive deeper into how to use grid

### Useful resources
